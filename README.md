# -Renewable-Energy-System-Design
This project designs a sustainable energy supply system for an off-grid building (housing 150 employees) in Newquay, Cornwall, UK. It integrates three renewable energy sources—**wind, tidal, and wave energy**—with an energy storage system to meet:  
- Annual energy consumption: 180 MWh  
- Minimum power supply (9:00–17:00 working hours): 60 kW  
- System lifespan: At least 20 years  
- Core goal: Reduce carbon emissions (83% reduction vs. diesel generators) and align with UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 12.

## Key Design Content  
### 1. Site Selection  
- Selected Location: Newquay, Cornwall, UK  
- Selection Criteria: Weighted scoring based on wind speed, tidal stream velocity, wave height, resource reliability, and local infrastructure. Newquay scored 8.3 (outperforming Leuchars and Twyny).

### 2. Energy Device Design  
| Energy Type               | Core Specifications                                                                 | Annual Power Contribution |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine | 3-blade design / NACA 6409 airfoil / TSR = 5 / 30m steel tower / GRP blades / Dual planetary gearbox (60:1 ratio) | 58%                       |
| Horizontal Axis Tidal Turbine | 6-blade design / NACA 0020 airfoil / Venturi tube (flow acceleration) / GRP blades / Steel tripod foundation / 15kW permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) | 15% |
| Wave Point Absorbers      | 2 units / PVC buoy / 45-steel connectors / 2m-diameter float                        | 27%                       |

### 3. Energy Storage System  
- Core Equipment: BLUESUN BSMS1-50K MPPT inverter (rated 50kW / max 60kW), HELIOX FAST DC 50kW charger, 600kWh battery bank.  
- Function: Store surplus energy in winter to supplement summer supply gaps (e.g., during worst-case conditions in August, stored energy meets the 60kW demand during working hours).

### 4. Economic & Environmental Benefits  
- Costs: Total cost of wind turbine = £139,100; Total cost of tidal turbine = £107,300.  
- Carbon Emissions: 4.7×10⁵ kg CO₂ over 20 years (83% reduction vs. a 60kW diesel generator, which emits 2.8×10⁶ kg CO₂).  
- Sustainability: Aligns with UN SDG 12 (efficient use of natural resources, reduced carbon emissions).
